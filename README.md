## Project Background

***Yearâ€‘inâ€‘Review: Coffee Shop Financials Aprâ€¯2024â€‘Marâ€¯2025***

  Conducted analysis in SQL to surface insights on sales trends and metrics from a data set containing 15,000 orders. Worked independently for a few weeks to clean and analyse data in SQL, and built performance dashboards in Excel to visualise trends. Related to revenue performance, cost efficiency, and product-level profitability. The aim is to demonstrate how data analysis can highlight trends, identify risks, and recommend actions that support stronger financial performance.

## Executive Summary

#### Overview of Findings 

**Stable revenue with rising risk in costs**: Monthly revenues held steady at around **Â£10,000â€“Â£11,500**, with **costs averaging ~12% of revenue**. Projections suggest revenue could **grow ~3% per month**, reaching nearly **Â£15,000 by March 2026**. However, costs are forecast to exceed budgeted targets after **October 2025** unless closely managed.  
**Significant seasonality and volatility**: Some months (May, July, August) exceeded expectations by **Â£300â€“Â£600**, while others (September, December, February) fell short by up to **Â£800**. This indicates pronounced seasonal demand swings and external factors affecting performance.

## Recommendations:

These findings suggest that while the business is profitable, it faces risks from seasonal dips, rising cost pressures, and inefficiencies in product mix and inventory. The following recommendations are intended to address these risks, improve margins, and support more consistent, sustainable growth.

Based on the analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended to strengthen the businessâ€™ profit margins and reduce performance volatility:  
1. **Adjust product recipe to reduce cost per unit** â€” Revise ingredients or portion sizes where feasible to lower production cost without compromising quality or customer satisfaction.  
2. **Position the product as seasonal** â€” Emphasise its appeal during highâ€‘demand winter months through targeted marketing and limitedâ€‘time offerings, ensuring inventory and staffing are aligned with seasonal demand.  
3. **Enhance stock management practices** â€” Monitor stock levels more closely so that inventory targets remain within 12â€‘15% of daily sales, reducing waste and holding costs. Together, these measures will help mitigate risks stemming from seasonal swings and product inefficiencies. More refined forecasting, tighter cost control, and product optimisation will support more consistent, sustainable growth and improve overall margins.
