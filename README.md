## Project Background

***Year‑in‑Review: Coffee Shop Financials Apr 2024‑Mar 2025***

  Conducted analysis in SQL to surface insights on sales trends and metrics from a data set containing 15,000 orders. Worked independently for a few weeks to clean and analyse data in SQL, and built performance dashboards in Excel to visualise trends. Related to revenue performance, cost efficiency, and product-level profitability. The aim is to demonstrate how data analysis can highlight trends, identify risks, and recommend actions that support stronger financial performance.

## Executive Summary

#### Overview of Findings 

**Stable revenue with rising risk in costs**: Monthly revenues held steady at around **£10,000–£11,500**, with **costs averaging ~12% of revenue**. Projections suggest revenue could **grow ~3% per month**, reaching nearly **£15,000 by March 2026**. However, costs are forecast to exceed budgeted targets after **October 2025** unless closely managed.  
**Significant seasonality and volatility**: Some months (May, July, August) exceeded expectations by **£300–£600**, while others (September, December, February) fell short by up to **£800**. This indicates pronounced seasonal demand swings and external factors affecting performance.  

**Strong overall performance with balanced category mix:**
Total gross revenue reached **£129K** from **23K transactions** over the period (Apr 2024–Mar 2025). Revenue levels remained relatively stable month to month, showing steady customer engagement across key categories.

**Hot Drinks dominate sales performance:**
Hot Drinks accounted for nearly **50% of total revenue (£64.38K)**, making them the primary income driver. Cold Drinks followed with **~25% (£32.96K)**, while Bakery and Snacks contributed **~13% (£16.23K)** and **~12% (£15.28K)** respectively.

**Seasonal peaks and dips evident:**

Revenue trends show noticeable seasonality — **Hot Drinks peaked in colder months** (e.g., May and early winter), while **Cold Drinks rose during warmer months** (June–August). Bakery and Snacks remained stable but with lower volume.
Sustained consistency despite fluctuations:
Monthly revenues for all categories show overall stability after mid-year, suggesting established demand patterns. The moderate fluctuations across months imply predictable seasonality rather than sharp volatility.  

**Growth opportunities in underperforming categories:**
While Hot Drinks drive most revenue, diversifying offerings or promotions for **Snacks and Bakery** could capture additional market share and reduce dependency on seasonal drink performance.

#### Produuct Focus:Cappuccino
**Strong sales with cappuccino as the top performer:**
Cappuccino generated the highest revenue among all products, driving a significant share of the £11K total gross revenue from 2,048 total orders between April 2024 and March 2025. It consistently outperformed other top-selling drinks such as Latte, Hot Chocolate, and Cold Mocha.  

**Morning sales dominate performance:**
Most cappuccino orders occurred in the morning (59%), with lunch (37%) and afternoon (4%) contributing smaller portions. This indicates strong early-day demand and highlights the importance of morning-focused promotions and service readiness.  

**Stable yet seasonal sales pattern:**
Monthly cappuccino revenue fluctuated between **£1,600 and £2,200**, showing mild dips in early winter but strong recoveries by March 2025. This pattern suggests consistent customer loyalty with modest seasonal variation rather than volatility.  

**Opportunities for cross-selling and diversification:**
Given cappuccino’s strong base, pairing it with bakery items or snacks during peak morning hours could increase average transaction values and enhance overall revenue stability.

## Recommendations:

These findings suggest that while the business is profitable, it faces risks from seasonal dips, rising cost pressures, and inefficiencies in product mix and inventory. The following recommendations are intended to address these risks, improve margins, and support more consistent, sustainable growth.

Based on the analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended to strengthen the business’ profit margins and reduce performance volatility:  
1. **Adjust product recipe to reduce cost per unit** — Revise ingredients or portion sizes where feasible to lower production cost without compromising quality or customer satisfaction.  
2. **Position the product as seasonal** — Emphasise its appeal during high‑demand winter months through targeted marketing and limited‑time offerings, ensuring inventory and staffing are aligned with seasonal demand.  
3. **Enhance stock management practices** — Monitor stock levels more closely so that inventory targets remain within 12‑15% of daily sales, reducing waste and holding costs. Together, these measures will help mitigate risks stemming from seasonal swings and product inefficiencies. More refined forecasting, tighter cost control, and product optimisation will support more consistent, sustainable growth and improve overall margins.
