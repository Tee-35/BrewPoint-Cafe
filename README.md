  Conducted analysis in SQL to surface insights on sales trends and metrics for a self-created data set containing 15,000 orders. Worked independently for a few weeks to clean and analyse data in SQL, and built performance dashboards in Excel to visualise trends. Related to revenue performance, cost efficiency, and product-level profitability. The aim is to demonstrate how data analysis can highlight trends, identify risks, and recommend actions that support stronger financial performance.

â€¢	Forecasts project steady growth of **~3% per month**, reaching nearly **Â£15k by Mar 2026**.        
â€¢	Budgeted targets were more conservative (~Â£11k revenue), ensuring realistic expectations.     
â€¢	**Conclude:** Profitability is strong, but costs are forecast to rise above target after Oct 2025, requiring close monitoring.

â€¢	Strong months: **May, July, Aug 2024** (+Â£300â€“Â£600 above target).  
â€¢	Weak months: **Sep, Dec, Feb** (up to -Â£800 below target).    
â€¢	Overall: Budgeting is accurate, but revenue is volatile due to **seasonal demand and external factors.**    
â€¢	**Recommendation:** Adjust targets to account for seasonality and review marketing/promotions for weaker months. Work with the product and sales team to further understand volatility in variance swings.

â€¢	Average monthly revenue: **Â£300â€“Â£400**; cost-to-sales ratio: **25.2%**.     
â€¢	Recipe change (remove whipped cream) reduces cost ratio to **21.9%**, saving **~Â£150 annually.**     
â€¢	Sales peak in winter, but overstocking leads to low turnover (6% daily sales).    
**â€¢	Recommendations:**
1.	Recipe adjustment (reduce cost per unit).
2.	Position as **seasonal product** to align with winter demand.
3.	Improve stock management (target 12â€“15% daily sales).

**Conclusion**
The business shows strong profitability, but seasonal swings and product inefficiencies present risks. Through refined forecasting, tighter cost control, and product adjustments, the company can improve margins and ensure growth is both consistent and sustainable.
