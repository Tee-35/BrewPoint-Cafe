Sales report from a local Coffee shop from the previous financial year.
Conducted analysis in SQL to surface insights on sales trends and metrics for a self-created data set containing 15,000 orders. Worked independently for a few weeks to clean and analyse data in SQL, and built performance dashboards in Excel to visualise trends. Related to revenue performance, cost efficiency, and product-level profitability.
