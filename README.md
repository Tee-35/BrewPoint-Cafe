## Project Background

***Yearâ€‘inâ€‘Review: Coffee Shop Financials Aprâ€¯2024â€‘Marâ€¯2025***

  Conducted analysis in SQL to surface insights on sales trends and metrics from a data set containing 15,000 orders. Worked independently for a few weeks to clean and analyse data in SQL, and built performance dashboards in Excel to visualise trends. Related to revenue performance, cost efficiency, and product-level profitability. The aim is to demonstrate how data analysis can highlight trends, identify risks, and recommend actions that support stronger financial performance.

â€¢	Revenue between Apr 2024â€“Mar 2025 remained steady at **Â£10kâ€“Â£11.5k per month**, with costs averaging **Â£1.7k** (12% of revenue).     
â€¢	Forecasts project steady growth of **~3% per month**, reaching nearly **Â£15k by Mar 2026**.        
â€¢	Budgeted targets were more conservative (~Â£11k revenue), ensuring realistic expectations.     
â€¢	**Conclude:** Profitability is strong, but costs are forecast to rise above target after Oct 2025, requiring close monitoring.
                

**Variance Analysis â€“ Revenue Apr 24 â€“ Mar 25  against Previous year Target Apr 23 â€“ Mar 24**

â€¢	Strong months: **May, July, Aug 2024** (+Â£300â€“Â£600 above target).  
â€¢	Weak months: **Sep, Dec, Feb** (up to -Â£800 below target).    
â€¢	Overall: Budgeting is accurate, but revenue is volatile due to **seasonal demand and external factors.**    
â€¢	**Recommendation:** Adjust targets to account for seasonality and review marketing/promotions for weaker months. Work with the product and sales team to further understand volatility in variance swings.


**Product Focus â€“ Hot Chocolate**

<img width="451" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2fe71d-474b-4fbf-b938-dff56dea981c" />

â€¢	Average monthly revenue: **Â£300â€“Â£400**; cost-to-sales ratio: **25.2%**.     
â€¢	Recipe change (remove whipped cream) reduces cost ratio to **21.9%**, saving **~Â£150 annually.**     
â€¢	Sales peak in winter, but overstocking leads to low turnover (6% daily sales).    

## Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, the following strategic actions are recommended to strengthen the businessâ€™ profit margins and reduce performance volatility:  
1. **Adjust product recipe to reduce cost per unit** â€” Revise ingredients or portion sizes where feasible to lower production cost without compromising quality or customer satisfaction.  
2. **Position the product as seasonal** â€” Emphasise its appeal during highâ€‘demand winter months through targeted marketing and limitedâ€‘time offerings, ensuring inventory and staffing are aligned with seasonal demand.  
3. **Enhance stock management practices** â€” Monitor stock levels more closely so that inventory targets remain within 12â€‘15% of daily sales, reducing waste and holding costs. Together, these measures will help mitigate risks stemming from seasonal swings and product inefficiencies. More refined forecasting, tighter cost control, and product optimisation will support more consistent, sustainable growth and improve overall margins.
